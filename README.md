# aceryansoft.sqlflow
C# light and fluent wrapper to easily use multiple sql databases (Sql server,Oracle,PostgreSql,Mysql,Sybase) with the same code while targeting dotnet standard 2.0 , dotnet framework 4.6.1 and above.

aceryansoft.sqlflow is not a real ORM (Object-Relational-Mapping), it is just a small contribution to help others who are old enough to continue building and querying their own sql schemas.
